# Grind Mode 🧠🔥

- 📌 **Group rituals by folders**
- ⚡ **Lightning-fast UX with focus on simplicity**
- 🌙 **Dark mode**

## 📱 Philosophy

Grind Mode is built with one main principle: discipline through simplicity. Users shouldn't have to fight the app to build good habits — it should feel like second nature. That’s why performance and minimal UX are top priorities.

Inspired by David Goggins, the app emphasizes consistency, resilience, and self-accountability.
